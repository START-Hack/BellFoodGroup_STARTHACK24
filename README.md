## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

### Problem
"Healthy and happy employees are good employees". This guiding principle is very important to us - a sustainable company that operates throughout Europe.
There is a lot of change in today's VUCA world. Everything is changing, there is a lot of hustle and bustle and influencing factors from all sides.

As an employer, we are obliged to fulfil our responsibility towards our employees in this environment. The difficulty in our group lies on the one hand in the geographical expansion and on the variety of multiple locations and cultures on the other hand. A great deal of coordination is required to do justice to all people and their health and well-being needs.

We would like to support our employees in the following factors wherever possible: 
-	health
-	nutrition
-	exercise
-	well-being
-	work place design
-	resilience
-	mindfulness
-	social interactions
-	and much more

### Expected Final Product
We expect a virtual coach as a companion for our employees. It is important to note that we have employees in the administration as well as in the production environment. This coach should be a daily companion for everydays life which can be used during work or leisure time.
##	Functionalities
It should be possible to divide the range of functions into two main areas:
#	Function 1: Vital-Mentor 
Employees receive support in the areas described above, suggestions, advice and assistance. This should be implemented as counselling, coaching or general support with knowledge, experience, etc.
#	Function 2: Persona-Sim / Avatar
The avatar reacts to the behavior, interactions and inputs of the employees and simulates the result. It shows the behavior directly as a reflection and hanges based on the behavior, input and interactions with other people. "What if" questions should also be asked and simulated.
##	Dimensions
Two dimensions should be considered in the solution
#	Dimension 1: Personal
The focus lies on the personal perspective with its own benefits and further development for the individual. The utilization should be designed in such a way that it constantly motivates the user with various challenges and playful elements. The learning factor should not be neglected either.
#	Dimension 2: Social
The social aspect between employees must also be considered and is very important. It should be possible to interact and exchange ideas with other employees. What this mutual interaction between employees should look like is totally up to you and is not predetermined.
