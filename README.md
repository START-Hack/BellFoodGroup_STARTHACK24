## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

### Problem
"We take responsibility" is one of the three missions that have been defined for the Bell Food Group with which we want to differentiate ourselves as a company. Our employees make important decisions every day to improve sustainability in our company. 
To raise awareness among our employees, we want to develop an app that shows them their "ecological footprint" in a playful way and helps them to record and improve it. As the majority of our workforce does not have access to our company network, an App would be a user-friendly product and it would ensure the possibility to participate all employees. 

### Expected Final Product
Based on different employee profiles (e.g. production workers, sales representatives, truck drivers, managers, ...), employees can manually and automatically record their "ecological footprint" by recording their daily activities. 
For example, the managers or salespersons record their business trips, the production employees specify which activities they perform, how and in which plant, what they consume for lunch in the canteen and how they commute to work. In the factories, we are able to monitor the energy consumption of our production (for each location) through a variety of energy indicators and data points. (such as electricity, water consumption, etc. ).
Ideally, the tracking / collection of this data should be automated wherever possible. In order to determine the most feasible solution, the students` creativity is required.
The goal of this app is to help us bring all these parameters together, show employees their contribution to our sustainability goals, and motivate them to help us achieve them. In order to promote our employees contribution, they should be able to collect "Eco-Points" for their active contributions. Those points for active contributions can be achieved within the areas of environmental and social sustainability (e.g. commute with public transport / bike, regulate temperature in offices, plant trees at a team event, participate in our educational services like training, promote diversity, etc.). Different Dashboards (e.g. individual, location-wide, company-wide, group-wide) Company Data to facilitate the process could be an opportunity to display our employees contribution. It is important to note that the scaling of our employees' sustainability scores should not be dependent on their job group or role (e.g. a butcher has a worse score than an office employee).
Contests (maybe rewards) and gamification aspects convince our employees to use the app on a daily basis.
Overall, creativity is the most important factor when it comes to the development of this solution. Our expectation is the development and creation of a high quality user experience that makes sense, so that people really want to use the platform resp. the app and include it into their "daily business".

### Data
Employees should be able to enter individual and public corporate / personal data manually. Also, incorporating external data sources could be valuable. Those can provide a more comprehensive and comparative view of the company’s sustainability performance. For example, the app can integrate with public databases on energy consumption or carbon emissions to benchmark the company’s performance against industry standards or competitors.

The currently valid corporate sustainability strategy (check the resources) is mandatory until 2026 and consists of 8 strategic fields of action. You are being asked to find creative ways to integrate aspects of the sustainability goals wherever possible (not mandatory).

#### 1. Greenhouse gas emissions and energy
- We commit to science-based climate targets in accordance with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).
-	We reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 21% by 
2026 (Scope 1/2).
-	We develop targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chain (Scope 3) and promote corresponding measures and projects.
#### 2. Water
-	By 2026, we will reduce water consumption in our operations by 10% in non-risk areas and by 50% per unit of goods sold in risk areas.
-	We are optimizing our wastewater management.
#### 3. Disposal and recycling
-	By 2026, we will reduce operational food losses to below 1%.
-	By 2026, we will increase the share of self-produced, recyclable end-user packaging to at least 50%. 
#### 4. Ecosystems
-	We maintain sales of organic farming, animal husbandry and fish farming product labels at CHF 370 million.
-	By 2026, 72% of our fish and seafood range is rated "recommended" or "highly recommended" by WWF.
-	We source defined critical plant and animal raw materials, such as palm oil or soy, from deforestation- and transformation-free sources with a vision of "Zero Deforestation" in our supply chain.
#### 5. Animal welfare
-	We have implemented a company-wide animal welfare policy on animal welfare aspects by 2022.
-	37% of our animal raw materials and products across the Bell Food Group (60% in Bell Switzerland) are certified with an animal welfare product label by 2026.
#### 6. Safety and health in the workplace 
-	We promote the physical and mental health of all employees.
-	We have introduced a management system for occupational health and safety with a uniform standard at 100% of our operations by 2026.
#### 7. Conditions of employment (social sustainability) As an attractive employer
-	We offer modern employment conditions.
-	Actively promote the respect of human rights in our supply chain.
-	Require 100% of our direct suppliers (Tier-1) with a high social risk to have a valid social standard audit/certificate by 2026.
#### 8. Governance
-	We promote fair and ethical corporate governance and responsible tax policies across the entire supply chain.
-	We incorporate ESG criteria as part of comprehensive risk and financial management by 2026. ESG = Environment Social Governance.

### Technology
The goal of the app is to integrate as many existing parameters as we can. Existing interfaces (e.g. energy management) are used and publicly available key figures (e.g. CO2 emission for air travel) can also be used. Our expectation is a working prototype / app that demonstrates how to implement the requirements of the use cases and how to use it for the end user. However, there are no restrictions on the technologies to be used. There is no default for the programming and the tools used. Your creativity is needed here.
No live interfaces from Bell Food Group systems are to be included for this app at this time. This will be taken into account in a later implementation of the app. The energy data provided from the production plants can be used from the .CSV files.

## <p align="center"> Further Information: </p>

Employees in all areas of activity of the Bell Food Group can use the app to measure their contribution to our sustainability strategy. Real data from our productions are to be supplemented with publicly available key figures in order to obtain as comprehensive a picture as possible. The app should be intuitive and easy to use, and it should be fun for employees to determine their contribution.

- Here are a few examples of energy data from typical Bell Food Group production plants from diffrent divisions. The data sets go back three years and have data in the interval of 15 minutes. Typically, as in real life, the data is not complete and has gaps because the records did not work or because they do not exist.
